    <h2>Info about me:</h2>
    <p>I am a Finnish first year Computer Science student. I started
    studying in Tampere University in 2016, albeit at the Literature
    department. In 2018, I changed to CS and started honing my coding skills
    way back from around 2011, when I coded my very first program in BASIC
    language. Somewhere in 2012-2013 I coded my first Python program, which is
    sadly lost in the history of time with the other silly scripts I made. I
    learned other languages through taking courses at the university, with
    some exceptions in Web Developing, which I mainly learned using tutorials
