    <h2>Info about me:</h2>
    <p>Hi! I just graduated with a MSc / BSc degree in Computer Science. I started
    studying at Tampere University in 2016, albeit at the Literature
    department. In 2018, I changed to CS and started honing my coding skills
    way back from around 2011, when I coded my very first program in BASIC
    language. Somewhere in 2012-2013 I coded my first Python program, which is
    sadly lost in the history of time with the other silly scripts I made. I
    learned other languages through taking courses at the university, with
    some exceptions in Web Developing, which I mainly learned going through <a

      I was also a member of <a href="https://www.mensa.fi/"

        >these fellows.</a> I didn't use their services, so I discontinued the membership. Got some wallet loot for it though!
